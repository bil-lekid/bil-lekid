In 2010, 2 zetabytes of data is either created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide. Now in 2022 it is a whooping 97 ZETABYTES of data and soon in 2025 it would be 181 zetabytes, waiting to be data mined and used for cool stuff. I am an undergraduate in engineering physics, there I learned a lot of instrumentation and used a lot of simulation to learn and model building. One time a sudden thought came, isn't the sensor and AI technology getting more and more advanced as we are speaking. What if a simulation that would take hours to model the temperature in a building can be done in second? What if even unimportant data like the \"rat killed by cars every year\" or \"How many dust you inhale\" can be obtained in the near future? IT IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY. So in preparation to that I want to be able to utilize and have a strong knowledge of what to do with data.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Just a simple if statement to check length of string"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["haiya statement too long\n"]}],"source":["statement = \"If you are curious, answers will reveal itself\"\n","if len(statement) > 10:\n","    print('haiya statement too long')\n","\n","else:\n","    print(\"all good, statement not too long\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["----------\n","- first\n","- second\n","- third\n","\n","\n","[Press this link to obtain it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n","\n","\n","![IBM](https://cdn.iphoneincanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ibm.jpg)\n","```python\n","print(\"hello world\")\n","```\n","> This is a quote\n","~~This is a strikethrough~~"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.8.9 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.9"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"6a926afa313b26ae1264fdcf81c726a97e69f6ba2ba780f6aa901948710f8d6e"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
